## Neighborhood Map Project


This is my submision of Project: Neighbouhood Map for Udacity Front End Nanodegree.

It is KnockoutJS application which use Google Maps API and MediaWiki API to display popular locations to visit in Portsmouth, UK.

All locations are listed on the top of the map.
There is a search box on the map to search for listed locations.
When user click marker on the map or click on list, info window opens with:
  - additional information for the place
  - and link to more detailed info on Wikipedia.

To create this project I used Udacity lessons and forums, Google Search and Stack Overflow.


TO RUN: Download `.zip` file, extract it and open `index.html` in your browser.
