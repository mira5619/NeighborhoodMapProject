## Neighborhood Map Project

  This is my project 5 for Udacity Front End Nanodegree.

It is a map of Portsmouth UK with markers on popular locations to visit.
All locations are listed on the top of the map.
There is search box on the map to search for listed locations.
When user click on the marker, info window opens with additional information for the place and link to more detailed info on Wikipedia.

To create this project I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout JS, Bootstrap, Google Maps API and Wikipedia API.

TO RUN: Download `.zip` file, extract and open `index.html` in your browser.
